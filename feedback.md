1. .gitignore should be included so that the vendor folder and other directories that are installable by composer or npm are not put into source control.
2. a .env.example makes it easier to share code so others can have the defaults of the application set.
3. updating your README.md with info about the application and steps to start running it locally goes a long way to pick up where you left off.
4. you could just make the home page the create view instea of having a redirect.
